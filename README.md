# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default {
  // other rules...
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 'latest',
    sourceType: 'module',
    project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json'],
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
  },
}
```

- Replace `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` to `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`
- Optionally add `plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and add `plugin:react/recommended` & `plugin:react/jsx-runtime` to the `extends` list

1. Project Setup

Tools and Libraries:

    React: For building the user interface.
    TypeScript: For type safety and better development experience.
    Redux Toolkit: For state management.
    React Router: For navigation and routing.
    Tailwind CSS: For styling.
    Axios: For making HTTP requests.
    Formik/Yup: For form handling and validation.
    React Query: For data fetching and caching.
    Jest/React Testing Library: For testing.

Directory Structure:

bash

/src
  /api
  /assets
  /components
  /features
    /auth
    /dashboard
    /products
    /orders
    /users
  /hooks
  /pages
  /routes
  /services
  /store
  /styles
  /utils
  App.tsx
  index.tsx
  types.ts

2. Authentication and Authorization

Setup Authentication:

    Implement authentication with JWT (JSON Web Token).
    Use libraries like react-router-dom for protected routes.
    Create HOC (Higher Order Components) or custom hooks (useAuth) for managing authentication state.

Authorization:

    Define user roles (admin, user) and permissions.
    Use role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to certain parts of the dashboard.

3. State Management

Redux Toolkit:

    Use Redux Toolkit for efficient state management.
    Create slices for different features (products, orders, users, etc.).
    Use createAsyncThunk for asynchronous operations.

4. Data Fetching

React Query:

    Use React Query for data fetching, caching, and synchronization.
    Implement pagination and infinite scrolling where necessary.
    Use optimistic updates for a better user experience.

5. Components and Pages

Modular Components:

    Break down UI into reusable components (tables, forms, modals, etc.).
    Create higher-order components (HOCs) for common functionalities.

Pages:

    Dashboard: Overview of metrics and key data.
    Products: CRUD operations for products.
    Orders: Manage orders and track shipping.
    Users: Manage user accounts and roles.
    Settings: Application settings and configurations.

6. Forms and Validation

Formik and Yup:

    Use Formik for handling form state.
    Use Yup for schema-based form validation.

7. Styling

Tailwind CSS:

    Use Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development.
    Maintain a consistent design system using Tailwindâ€™s configuration.

8. Routing

React Router:

    Define routes for all dashboard pages.
    Use nested routes for better organization.
    Implement lazy loading for route components to improve performance.

9. Error Handling and Notifications

Error Handling:

    Use try-catch blocks in async functions.
    Display user-friendly error messages.

Notifications:

    Use a library like react-toastify for notifications.
    Provide feedback for actions like form submissions, deletions, etc.

10. Testing

Unit and Integration Tests:

    Write unit tests for components and utils.
    Write integration tests for components that interact with the Redux store or make API calls.
    Use Jest and React Testing Library for testing.
